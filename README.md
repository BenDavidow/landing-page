To run locally:

1. Checkout the repo.
2. Install gulp.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `gulp`.
5. To compile/minify your SASS & JS as you work, run `gulp watch`.
6. You can use livereload to have your changes auto-updated in the browser as you work. Install the livereload browser extension, activate it for the browser tab you're working on, and make sure you have `gulp watch` running. You'll also need to be serving up the site on a local server.
